      Central to the mission of the All of Us Research Program is the collection of information
      from diverse groups of people within the U.S. population. However, the Program must
      recognize the potential for resources collected in good faith to be used towards social
      detriment, like stigmatization. Stigmatizing research is any research proposal, project,
      or question that has the potential to instigate or promote marginalization, discrimination,
      or loss of status by a person or group of people. Stigma may be inherent
      in the research design (i.e. the formation of a research question based on prejudicial
      biases) or a byproduct of the research findings (i.e. the interpretation of findings in
      such a way as to promote negative stereotypes) and may be intentional or unintentional.
      While complete elimination of stigmatizing research based on use of the All of Us data
      resources is likely impossible, the Program is taking steps in earnest to prevent resource
      use with the potential to stigmatize and to punish people who misuse the resource to the
      detriment of others as appropriate.

    <div class="stigma-text">
      Stigma may be understood as convergence of the following components (adapted from
      <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363">Link
      and Phelan, 2001</a>):

      <li>
        <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">The identification and labeling of human differences.</span>
        <span class="stigma-text">
          Not all differences are deemed socially relevant. Certain differences—such as differences
          in skin color, ethnicity, country of origin, ancestry, sex, gender, sexual orientation,
          socioeconomic status, educational attainment, disability status, and body type—are
          considerably more prone to stigma than others. Salience of labels in such domains are
          dependent on a process during which gross oversimplification of an attribute or
          characteristic creates artificial categories, upon which contextually-specific social
          selection occurs.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
          The linking of labeled persons by dominant cultural belief to undesirable
          characteristics and formation of negative stereotypes.
        </span>
        <span class="stigma-text">
          A key feature in this process is the provision of characteristics that may be linked
          to one or more social labels. Scientific research can provide just such fodder, and
          the result can be arbitrary stereotypes socially perpetuated under the banner of science.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
          Separation of people into categories of “us” and “them” by applying said stereotypes.
        </span>
        <span class="stigma-text">
          The logical next step after the perpetration of a negative stereotype is the use
          of that stereotype to define in-groups and out-groups.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
          The experience of loss of status and discrimination by labeled persons.
        </span>
        <span class="stigma-text">
          This is the ultimate output of the stigma process. Here, “out-group” members are
          downwardly placed, with regards to the “in-group,” and subjected to detrimental
          treatment, consideration, or distinction based upon label(s), rather than merit.
          Discrimination can be leveraged by an individual or group towards an individual
          or collection of individuals. However, discrimination is particularly dangerous
          in its structural form, when discriminatory behavior becomes culturally accepted
          and accumulates to shape institutional practices that work to the disadvantage of
          labeled group(s), even in the absence of individual prejudices or discrimination.

      <li>
        <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
          The exercise of social, economic, political, or other power that reinforces the
          above processes, translating them into significant consequences for labeled
          individuals.
        </span>
        <span class="stigma-text">
          Without the uneven distribution of power, in-group prejudices would not carry
          the same negative consequences for out-group members.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="stigma-text">
      When these components converge, they produce widespread attitudes and beliefs that
      lead people to reject, avoid, or fear those they perceive as being different,
      resulting in detrimental inequities and unfair treatment at either the individual
      or group level.
