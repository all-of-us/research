      <div style={styles.text}>Central to the mission of the All of Us Research Program is the
        collection of information from diverse groups of people within the U.S. population.
        However, the Program must
        recognize the potential for resources collected in good faith to be used towards social
        detriment, like stigmatization. Stigmatizing research is any research proposal, project,
        or question that has the potential to instigate or promote marginalization, discrimination,
        or loss of status by a person or group of people. Stigma may be inherent
        in the research design (i.e. the formation of a research question based on prejudicial
        biases) or a byproduct of the research findings (i.e. the interpretation of findings in
        such a way as to promote negative stereotypes) and may be intentional or unintentional.
        While complete elimination of stigmatizing research based on use of the All of Us data
        resources is likely impossible, the Program is taking steps in earnest to prevent resource
        use with the potential to stigmatize and to punish people who misuse the resource to the
        detriment of others as appropriate.

      <div style={styles.text}>
        Stigma may be understood as convergence of the following components (adapted from
        <a href='https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363'> Link
          and Phelan, 2001
        </a>):
      </div>
      <ol style={styles.list}>
        {ListText.map(({header, text}, index) => {
          return  <li key={index} style={{marginTop: '1rem'}}>
             <span style={{...styles.text, 'fontWeight': 600, 'color': '#262262'}}>
               {header}
             </span>
             <span style={styles.text}>
               {text}

        When these components converge, they produce widespread attitudes and beliefs that
        lead people to reject, avoid, or fear those they perceive as being different,
        resulting in detrimental inequities and unfair treatment at either the individual
        or group level.
