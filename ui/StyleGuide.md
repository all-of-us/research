#Style Guide
##Work in Progress

When starting a UI card, always check Invision for latest designs.

We are working towards abstracting styles (and possibly components) where it makes sense. When starting a new UI ticket, look around. 
* Are there other places where elements similar to ones you are using are used? 
* If so, have we already abstracted out the style and/or component?
* If not, should you abstract out the style/component as part of your card?

#To Be Decided
For consistency:
* We should decide between px, em, rem and use them throughout
