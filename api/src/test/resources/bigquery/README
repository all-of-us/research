// Generating .ser files
1. Write the code necessary to get the query to execute successfully.
2. Attach a debugger so that the output of BigQueryService.executeQuery() can be inspected
3. Run the following code block in the debugger's "Evaluate Expression" feature

    // where tableResult is the output of BigQueryService.executeQuery()
    FileOutputStream file = new FileOutputStream("your_bq_output.ser");
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(file);
    out.writeObject(tableResult);
    out.close();
    file.close();

4. Find the output file by running this from the /api directory `find . -name your_bq_output.ser`
5. Copy that file into src/test/resources/bigquery/
6. See `FreeTierBillingServiceTest` to see an example on how to read the file and use it in tests

// Generating .json files
// This isn't necessary to run the tests but useful for having a human readable version of the test
// data since the serialized format is not.
1. Go to cloud.google.com and log in with the necessary google account, probably pmi-ops
2. Go to BigQuery
3. Run your query
4. Go to the JSON tab in the results window and copy/paste that into the src/test/resources/bigquery/ folder
