# This is a Swagger representation of the Shibboleth API run by the Broad Institute. See
# RW-4257 for documentation and links to the service source code.
#
# The Shibboleth service does not publish its own structured API, so this file was hand-crafted
# to allow client API code to be auto-generated in this repo.
