# Workbench

[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workbench.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workflows/workbench)

## Getting the code

* Run `git clone https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench`

To make changes, do:

* git checkout master
* git pull
* git checkout -b USERNAME/BRANCH_NAME
* (make changes and git add / commit them)
* git push -u origin USERNAME/BRANCH_NAME

And make a pull request in your browser at
https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench based on your upload.

After responding to changes, merge in GitHub.

## Setup

Docker must be installed to build and run code (For Google workstations, see
go/installdocker.). Ruby is required to run our development scripts, which
document common operations and provide a convenient way to perform them.

### UI

* Direct your editor to write swap files outside the source tree, so Webpack
does not reload when they're updated.
[Example for vim](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4593).

## Running the Dev Servers

### API: dev AppEngine appserver

From the `api/` directory:
```Shell
./project.rb dev-up
```

When the console displays "Dev App Server is now running", you can hit your
local API server under http://localhost:8081/api/.

Other available operations may be discovered by running:
```Shell
./project.rb
```

### UI

From the `ui/` directory:
```Shell
./project.rb dev-up
```

After webpack finishes the build, you can view your local UI server at
http://localhost:4200/. You can view the tests at http://localhost:9876/debug.html.

By default, this connects to our test API server. Use `--environment=$ENV` to
use an alternate `src/environments/environment.$ENV.ts` file and connect to a
different API server. To connect to your own API server running at
`localhost:8081`, pass `--environment=local`.

Other available operations may be discovered by running:
```Shell
./project.rb
```

#### You can regenerate classes from swagger with

```Shell
./project.rb swagger-regen
```

## Deploying

To deploy your local code to a given AppEngine project, run:

```
./deploy.py --project PROJECT --account ACCOUNT@pmi-ops.org
```

Example:

```
./deploy.py -p all-of-us-workbench-test -a dan.rodney@pmi-ops.org
```

You will be prompted to confirm the deployment. When it finishes, you will be able to access the
UI under http://PROJECT.appspot.com and the API under http://api.PROJECT.appspot.com.

## git-secrets

### Setup

Download the git-secrets tool.
If you are on a mac, run:
```Shell
  brew install git-secrets
```
If you are on Linux, run:
```Shell
rm -rf git-secrets
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
sudo make install && sudo chmod o+rx /usr/local/bin/git-secrets
cd ..
rm -rf git-secrets
```
### Running

git-secrets by default runs every time you make a commit. But if you
want to manually scan:
#### The Repository
```Shell
git secrets --scan
```
#### A File(s)
```Shell
git secrets --scan /path/to/file (/other/path/to/file *)
```
#### A Directory (recursively)
```Shell
git secrets --scan -r /path/to/directory
```
